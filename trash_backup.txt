Thank you for volunteering to present at the Biology-AI reading group (or for considering it)! Below are some tips for making a great presentation.

### Know your audience

You will be presenting to machine learning enthusiasts with varying levels of biology knowledge. You should assume that many people have minimal background in biology / your field of biology. 

### Presenting a paper

- If you are presenting your own work: the format is flexible but you should not exceed ~45 minutes. This will allow for a brief introduction at the start and a Q&A period at the end. 
- If you are presenting a paper from the literature: the format is flexible but recommended presentation length is ~20-30 minutes long. Discussion will follow.  
- Please let the group know at the start whether you will accept questions as the talk progresses or if all questions should be kept until the end.
- If you would like to practice setting up slides for presentation prior to the meeting (recommended), contact me and we can do a dry run a few minutes before the meeting starts.
