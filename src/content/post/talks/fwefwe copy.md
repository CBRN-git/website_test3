abstract: >
  The genomic diversification of viral pathogens during viral epidemics and pandemics represents a major adaptative route for infectious agents to circumvent therapeutic and public health initiatives. Historically, strategies to address viral evolution have relied on responding to emerging variants after their detection, leading to delays in effective public health responses. Because of this, a long-standing yet challenging objective has been to forecast viral evolution by predicting potentially harmful viral mutations prior to their emergence. The promises of artificial intelligence (AI) combined with the exponential growth of viral data collection infrastructures (due to the COVID-19 pandemic) have resulted in a research ecosystem highly conducive to this objective. In this review, we explore recent breakthroughs that have facilitated the forecasting of viral evolution in the context of an ongoing pandemic, with particular emphasis on deep learning architectures, including the promising potential of language models (LM). 
  The approaches discussed here employ strategies that leverage genomic, epidemiologic, immunologic and biological information.
